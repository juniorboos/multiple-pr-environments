[Medium Article](https://medium.com/xgeeks/how-to-create-and-adopt-design-systems-for-hyper-scaling-companies-a-6-step-approach-fd35dd430e3e)

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the pull request review process by enabling the creation of multiple environments for each pull request, which can be easily reviewed and tested.

This project is made with:

- **Vite** as a fast build tool and dev server
- **Storybook** for component-driven development
- **GitHub Actions** to automate workflows and deploy the app to GitHub Pages
- **GitHub Pages** to host the app

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
- To view the Storybook UI, run `npm run storybook`.

## Usage
Once the installation is complete, you can use this project as a boilerplate for your React projects. The Vite build tool and dev server make it fast and easy to develop and test your app, while Storybook provides a solid UI to preview components in isolation.
To deploy your app to GitHub Pages, simply create a PR or push to `main`.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please create a pull request.
